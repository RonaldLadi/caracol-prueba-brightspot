## 📰 Caracol – Proof Front-End Associate

This project is a frontend technical test, whose objective is to build a modular, scalable, and maintainable interface from JSON data, using Handlebars, LESS, and JavaScript with a clear architecture.

The main focus of development is on:

* Componentization
* Separation of responsibilities
* Frontend best practices
* Clear and understandable code for future maintenance

---
### Test objective

Build a web page that:

* Dynamically renders its content from a JSON file
* Uses Handlebars as a template engine
* Implements styles with LESS
* Manages interaction with JavaScript, applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Maintains a clean, scalable, and professional structure

### Technologies used

* Semantic HTML5
* Handlebars.js – View rendering
* LESS – Style preprocessor
* JavaScript (ES6+) – Logic and interactions
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Gulp – Task automation
* Node.js / NPM – Dependency management

## 📌 Key folders

* components/: Reusable components (actions, social, navigation, audioPlayer, etc.)
* templates/: Main templates (main.hbs)
* data/: Single source of data (data.json)
* js/: Project logic organized by responsibility

---
### 🧠 JavaScript Architecture

The project uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to organize logic and maintain clear responsibilities.

🧩 app.js – Orchestrator

### Responsibilities:

* Initialize the application
* Register Handlebars helpers
* Load the data JSON
* Render the main template

> Acts as the entry point of the project.


### 🧩 Handlebars Helpers

Global helpers are defined to improve view logic:

* eq: strict comparison
* includes: string validation

These helpers allow for:

* Conditional rendering
* Cleaner components
* Less logic in HTML

🎨 Styles (LESS)

* Use of global variables
* Independently styled components
* Mobile-first approach
* Organized and easy-to-maintain code

----
## ▶️ How to run the project

### 1. Install dependencies

npm install

### 2. Run the development environment

npm run dev

### 3. Open the project

Open index.html or the server generated by Gulp.

#### 🧪 Technical considerations

* The project is designed to be scalable
* Code readability was prioritized
* Each component has a single responsibility
* JSON acts as the single source of truth

#### 🚀 Possible future improvements

* Global state management
* Unit tests
* Dynamic module loading
* Asset optimization for production
